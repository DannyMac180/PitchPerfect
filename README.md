# PitchPerfect
Udacity's iOS Nanodegree PitchPerfect App

The first of Udacity's iOS Nanodegree project apps, Pitch Perfect allows the user to record their voice and play it back with effects added. This app will also let the user speed up or slow down the rate of playback, and experience fun echo and reverb effects. This first app is an introduction to the iOS development ecosystem.

What did I learn while building this app?

- Create a new project from existing iOS app templates
- Add buttons, images, labels and create user interfaces for the app using the Storyboard
- Leverage the Model View Controller (MVC) design principles; this includes writing custom model code, and using       UIViewController, and UIView
- Create Outlet and Action connections between the views and view controllers. Benefit from the power of Delegates by using them in code
- Navigate between two scenes in the app using UINavigationController
- Play audio files using AVFoundation’s AVAudioEngine class
- Run the iOS simulator and download the app on a physical device
- Search documentation, resolve bugs, and read other people’s code
